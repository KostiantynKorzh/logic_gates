# Logic Gates

Tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
Based on primitive logic gates it allows creating more complex structure

### Theory

### Overview

You can add different gates on playground and connect them together

Area on the left is a place where you can grab new gate and add it to playground<br />
To add new input switch (on the left), click "Add switch" button<br />

To delete connection, click on gate input with connection to delete<br />
To delete gate, right click on it<br />
To delete input switch (on the left), right click on it <br />

### Technologies used in this project

* Typescript
* Webpack
* P5.js (Processing) - drawing and rendering lib

### Features to implement in the future

* Creating custom gate (e.g. register) and save it as a gate with inputs and outputs
* Scrolling playground to make it infinite
* Smooth lines for connections

This project is inspired by videos made by Sebastian Lague [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA&t=574s&ab_channel=SebastianLague) and [How Do Computers Remember?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0-izyq6q5s&t=4s&ab_channel=SebastianLague)
and his tool, he made to visualize logic circuits
